## :dart: About

In this project, I created an application to fetch users from the GitHub API. I implemented a local storage feature using LocalStorage to maintain a list of searched users. Additionally, the application displays details about each user found. For building this application, I utilized the Angular framework, leveraging its robust structure and rapid development capabilities. Integration with the GitHub API provides dynamic access to user profiles, enriching the user experience. This project represents an opportunity to explore Angular and its features, while offering a practical and useful application for searching and viewing GitHub user profiles.
